                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Jake Melville. I was born and raised in Sparta, NJ. After graduating college I went on to
                    study political Science at Colgate University. After college I cam back to the home state on NJ.I am
                    in the process of becoming a full-stack web developer. I specialze in
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am a former college athlete and understand the importance of teamwork
                    and communication. I am currently enrolled in a Coding Boot-camp through Rutgers University using
                    the Trilogy cirriculum. After the completion of this course I will be seeking employment
                    immediately. </p>

                        project. The Cat & Mouse game was made through Scratch, while my Code Refactor, and future
                        projects were made through Visual Code Studio. All projects were made using HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript.</p>
